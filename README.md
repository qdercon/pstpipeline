# pstpipeline

## an R package to clean, analyse, and present data from a large online learning study.

The study consisted of:

Key elements of the package:

-   parsing/importing functions to convert .txt JATOS outputs to usable R objects: import_single, import_multiple, plot_single

-   analysis functions:

-   model checks (simulations, parameter recovery, posterior predictive checks)

-   plotting functions (both for raw data and for results of analyses)

Please note much of this code (and accompanying files) was adapted from other packages, in particular hBayesDM, and is not meant to supercede or replace this work, but simply to make it easier for our specific analyses to be replicated by others.
